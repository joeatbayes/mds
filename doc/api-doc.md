## Sample clients that show how to  

### Add Data to the queue###

### Retrived data in the queue###

### Stress Test Reader###

> > The stress test to fully utilize all the core on the box requires that multiple mds listeners as is described in main [readme](../README.md)  Then on a separate box run one or more copies of each of these testers.  They will report the number of requests per second in the shell window where each one is running.      
> >
> > Once you have them all running you will take a screenshot showing the results form each of the testers assuming that you have each window shrunk down so they all fit.  Then you have to add the TPS numbers from all the clients together to get the net cumulative  TPS. 
> >
> > I admit this is a primitive approach but it works and it makes it easy to run the test clients on many different client boxes or to run all of them  on the main box.
