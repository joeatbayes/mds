# BROKEN PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THIS YET.  
### CONTACT ME IF YOU WANT TO TRY  MDS  AND I WILL MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO LOCATE A CORRECT VERSION

When I was working on the API document I found that this version of the code is broke.   I had a perfectly working version when testing previously.   I should have added it to github then but I waited a couple years and a couple of laptops.  Well live and learn.  

If you want to try MDS then please let me know and I will make it a priority to either fix this version or locate the good version. 

NOTE:  I would have made this repository private until fixed but GitHub doesn't have free private repositories.  Sorry for the inconvienience.

###Changing Market Conditions###
Since I wrote this version a few things have changed.  Riak has emerged as a more sophisticated approach.  I think Riak may be overkill for forward propagated caching.  I have also found that during the period from 2015 through 2016 Elastic search has become so fast at returning detailed body data along with search results that in many instances using a separate metadata cache is no longer necessary.  There are exceptions which is where MDS may will continue to fill a valuable architectural niche especially when you need to support nearly infinite parallel read capacity limited only by network bandwidth. 

###Isolated toasters is still the safest way to scale ###
I am still a firm believer in a forward propagated cache as one of the best way to scale web scale systems.    I also still believe that complete isolation of the read nodes except for that Queue that delivers them data is the best way to deliver very high availability with maximum fault tolerance.     One problem I have with the marketing FUD for both elastic and Riak is that they claim manage federating many nodes into a single large federated search database which seems like an ideal approach but when something goes wrong it takes the entire enterprise cluster down all at once in ways that can take days to diagnose an fix.   

The MDS toaster architecture is far less complex and in many ways far less sophisticated since it depends on a queue to deliver the data.  One it can virtually guarantee is that two physically separated nodes of MDS will not fail at the same time due to a bug that ripples through a cluster.  

We have seen major companies experience mutli-day outages when their Elastic search cluster failed because they didn't build this level of isolation built into their architecture.  Even when using the very best federated database to allow large read volumes and transparent data sharding you still must run at least two completely isolated sets of these servers or it is nearly guaranteed that it will eventually cause a complete outage that is difficult and time consuming to fix. 

One thing I still struggle with is that the federated search FUD is still better than reality.    If you take two elastic search nodes run them completely isolated and measure the maximum query capacity of the two servers the TPS and degradation under load is still substantially better than if you create them as a elastic search cluster. When using 3 nodes when completely isolated we found a 3X performance capacity.  When used as a federated cluster the same hardware only delivered about 1.5X and there was a higher probability that something silly like a broken version upgrade on one node crashing the entire cluster.    Isolated toasters require a little more effort to plan deployment since you need a queue mechanism to deliver the data but it still delivers the greatest performance per $ of server cost and the highest degree of resistance to complete site outage.

---------------
===============

MDS is what I call a forward propagated data cache.   A common use is to extract data as it changes in SQL or NOSQL master databases and push it through a Queue system to one or more MDS servers as JSON, XML or TXT snippets.   When this detail data is needed it can be retrieved fast with high availability while keeping the runtime load off more expensive master servers. 

MDS was originally designed to provide high speed data once you know what the keys are.  A common use case is to retrieve object ID from the search engine or database then retrieve the JSON snippets needed for those documents from MDS.   MSD scales better than databases and it is less expensive to add more nodes.   With horizontal scalability it becomes relatively easy to meet very large scale demands.   MDS has also been used to retrieve detailed stock fundamental data and even for client side applications where it reduced the load on master RDBS enough to extend the server life by years.

> #### Why not a traditional cache strategy:

> > The main reason is that cache with return to origin on miss in a SOA architecture suffers from accumulated latency and services still have to be scaled to meet read storms demands which is expensive.
> >
> > One of the larger companies I worked at had a web page that ended up making over 300 SOA calls to services.  These services made their own SOA calls so the call chain ended was  7 layers deep.   
> >
> > In a big company each SOA service has to live within a budget so they end up using  a local cache to reduce load on their database master servers.     The Web page calls service-A which caches for 4 minutes.  Service-A calls service-B which caches for 8 minutes.   Service-B  calls service-C  which caches for 6 minutes. 
> >
> > Each of these data freshness commitments were scrupulously negotiated with the service consumers but they still added up to 4 + 8 + 6 = 18 minutes of data staleness.  It also incurred significant redundant costs since each of these services has to be scaled to meet load from miss storms.   
> >
> > When pieces of data  changed in service-C they can be packaged as a JSON, XML or txt object.   The serialization can be done by database trigger or more often by the service writing into the database.  The packaged data snippets are pushed into a Queue and can be delivered to the entire fleet of MDS servers in under 200ms using Kafka or typically under 10ms when using [FastQueueFS](https://github.com/joeatbayes/fastQueueFS).
> >
> > We are looking at forward propagation sub 200ms compared to layered SOA cache of 18 18 minutes stale data.  The 200ms version makes it easier to meet business demands that require fresh data.    
> >
> > There are a few cases such as Availability to Ship that absolutely must be checked against the master database but with web commerce you could have multiple people looking at the same items ready to purchase.  It isn't until they press the order button that it becomes critical and must be reserved in the master.    If you don't have that item available to sell you probably don't want to show it as available on prior screens.   Having a version of  availability to ship that is gauranteed to be no more than 200ms old is much better than a 18 minute old version because it allows services other than the actual order placement to access the cached data without any load on the availability to ship service.   Without the forward propagated cache, every time the items is displayed in a search or web page it may produce multiple hits against a mission critical service.    Scaling transitionally safe databases used for mission critical services to meet high read loads when what you really need it to meet is the worst case order submission rate is wasteful.  
> >
> > When service consumers know a given piece of data might be 18 minutes they object and start demanding the availability to ship service to be massively and expensively over scaled.  This kind of over scaling when replicated across many services is tremendously expensive so even leading ecommerce companies result to caching.  If they make the easy but wrong choice and put a traditional caches in-front of individual services it makes the data freshness problem worse and total cost per page rises.
> >
> > This assumes the traffic load is heavily read weighted.   When it is more heavily write oriented we have to do a little more planning because we can end up in scenarios where the network can not carry the traffic from the Queue to MDS fast enough to maintain the latency promises.     In very large data environments we also have to shard or partition the data across multiple MDS servers.  

MDS has been SOA latency optimized.  This essentially means that each HTTP request allows the client to retrieve upto 500 items by key at a time or to update as many as will fit in the max acceptable post size.  This prevents the downstream client from making many repeated calls which accumulates latency.  It also minimizes the temptation to make many requests in parralell which wastes machine resources on both machines and in the network. 

MDS Leverages Linux file cache to deliver near RAM performance for many Terrabyte data sets.  MDS is Horizontally scalable in a toaster style architecture to provide nearly unlimited read rates. 

### Performance Tests 

> During 2015 I tested this system utilizing all the available cores on a R8 virtual machine using the default local disk configuration and it stabilized at 45K requests per second with a 3K average body size body.  This worked because the requests were bypassing the network inside the same box.  The CPU Utilization never peaked above 80% even when running the clients locally.  
>
> We could only reach 22K per second when the test clients ran on external boxes because we saturated the server network adapter.        Preliminary tests indicated that we could hit sustain over 60K requests per second on a physcial server with a 10 Gig network connection.
>
> At that time the client I using the MDS system was one of the largest consumer referral services in the USA.  A single MDS server running on a R8 virt could meet their entire load with 50% capacity to spare.  As a distributed architect I do not like single points of failure so I had them deploy 3 smaller virts so we could take one down for service and still be two failures away from an outage. 
>
> One of the difficult aspect of scaling a MDS fleet is that we rapidly exceed the data capacity of powerful load balancers.  This is one reason I tend to prefer building client side dispatch into the services calling MDS so the traffic can bypass the load balancer bottleneck.   Modern network routers and switches have more options to manage traffic with large data volumes. In very large data environments we may still have to partition the MDS servers into different network segments so heavy traffic doesn't have to cross the segment boundary.  Otherwise we risk overwhelming the network choke points and they are expensive to upgrade.  Luckily this is relatively easy with the queue feed system.

# Getting Started

## Starting the server ##

> **Read the section on install and configuration below**.  
>
> Change to the directory where you have placed the MDS source code.
>
> Run:
>
> ```shell
> node MDSServer.js 9839 ./config ./data  > log/mdsserver9839.log.txt
> ```
>
> The  bat files start_mds_server_9839.bat through _9848 are convienience utility to start many MDS servers.  This is enough listeners to fully occupy a 8 core box until the network is saturated. 

> #### Running Multiple Listeners####
>
> Node.js has a critical weakness in that a problem can easily crash the server.   The other main challenge is that you can not utilize all CPU cores available in a modern system using single network listener.    
>
> There are many ways to work around this and some libraries than claim to run multi-process but the most fool proof way I have found it to run # of cores -1 listeners as separate processes.  This maximizes isolation and risk between processes which is always desirable in high availability systems.   
>
> The MDS server is designed to allow many readers to run many listeners on the same data directory.    By running many readers we eliminate the risk of a problem in one crashing the others while we can easily tune the number of listeners to maximize request capacity for the available hardware.
>
> An example of this would be:
>
> > ```
> > node MDSServer.js 9839 ./config ./data  > log/mdsserver9839.log.txt
> > node MDSServer.js 9840 ./config ./data  > log/mdsserver9840log.txt
> > node MDSServer.js 9841 ./config ./data  > log/mdsserver9841.log.txt
> > node MDSServer.js 9842 ./config ./data  > log/mdsserver9842.log.txt    
> > ```
>
> It is considered best practice to publish a single URI such as http://CatalogCache.compname.org  and use haproxy or nginx to balance requests between the node instances.   It is also possible to accomplish the same  many load balancers.  
>
> > > > My personal preference is to skip the extra server node add a small client library that routes requests between servers giving preference to the instances responding fastest.   
> > > >
> > > > This  routing technique is needed anyway because any single server will eventually be too small to serve very large web sites so you will need the ability to route requests between a fleet of servers anyway.   
>
> You need at least two physical or two isolated virtual servers each running MDS to allow a single server to be brought down for service without causing a site outage.  My preference as a distributed architect is a minimum fleet size of 3 so I am always 2 servers away from failure. 
>
> One last thing never expose these servers directly to the public internet.  They have been very stable and ran for months under high loads but the HTTP listener library has not been hardened for direct access from web clients.  If you need to expose the web traffic do it though two HAProxy nodes or something similar in your router. 
>
> ### Performance Notes###
>
> MDS primary limit is generally the IO capacity on the primary network card.   The faster this call the more data MDS can serve.  The second limit is generally the speed of the underlying file system under worst case miss storms.  These do not happen often but faster hard disks will help maximize total system performance at moderate costs. 
>
> MDS makes heavy use of the linux file cache so the Linux system should be configured to maximize the amount of RAM available for use in file cache.  This contra-indicates running MDS on the same server with other processes that consume a lot of RAM.   
>
> Never run MDS using SAN or remote storage arrays it will kill the performance.

## Install & Configuration##

**Install Node.JS**

> > To Install Node For Linux See:   https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager

**Add nodejs executable to system PATH**

> Under windows this is normally set with PATH=Path="C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs"   or add this the PATH envVar under System -> Enviornment Variables in the control panel. 
>
> Under linux this is  normally set in the .bashrc

**Change Linux File Limits:**
   The design of the Node.js system uses async IO which may open hundreds
   of files waiting for callback. We need to have the user running MDS
   set to a soft limit of 100,000 files and hard limit of 200,000 files
   with a system wide max limit of 400,000 files.
